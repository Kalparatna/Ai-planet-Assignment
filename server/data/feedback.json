    "original_solution": "**Problem:** Area of Triangle ### Solution: ### Step 1 **Step 1:** Problem: Area of Triangle ## Area of a Triangle: Various Methods This document outlines several methods to calculate the area of a triangle, depending on the information available. ### 1. Base and Height **Problem Statement:** Given the base (b) and height (h) of a triangle, find its area (A). **Formula:** A = (1/2) * b * h **Explanation:** The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height. The height must be perpendicular to the base. **Example:** If a triangle has a base of 20 and a height of 12, then: A = (1/2) * 20 * 12 = 120 **Final Answer:** The area of the triangle is 120 square units. ### 2. Two Sides and the Included Angle **Problem Statement:** Given two sides (a and b) of a triangle and the included angle (C) between them, find its area (A). **Formula:** A = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C) **Explanation:** This formula uses trigonometry to find the area. The \"included angle\" is the angle formed by the two given sides. The sine function relates the angle to the ratio of sides in a right triangle. **Example:** If a = 7, b = 10, and C = 25 degrees, then: A = (1/2) * 7 * 10 * sin(25\u00b0) A \u2248 (1/2) * 7 * 10 * 0.4226 A \u2248 14.79 **Final Answer:** The area of the triangle is approximately 14.79 square units. ### 3. Heron's Formula (Three Sides) **Problem Statement:** Given the lengths of all three sides (a, b, and c) of a triangle, find its area (A). **Steps:** 1. **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s):** s = (a + b + c) / 2 2. **Apply Heron's Formula:** A = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] **Explanation:** Heron's formula allows you to calculate the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides. The semi-perimeter is simply half of the triangle's perimeter. **Example:** If a = 5, b = 5, and c = 5 (equilateral triangle), then: 1. s = (5 + 5 + 5) / 2 = 7.5 2. A = \u221a[7.5(7.5 - 5)(7.5 - 5)(7.5 - 5)] A = \u221a[7.5 * 2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5] A = \u221a[117.1875] A \u2248 10.825 **Final Answer:** The area of the triangle is approximately 10.825 square units.",

    "original_solution": "### Step 1 **Source: Web Search** **Problem:** A train passes a station platform in 36 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform? ## Problem Statement: A train passes a station platform in 36 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform? ## ### Solution: ### Step 2 **Step 1:** **1. Convert the speed of the train to meters per second (m/s):** Speed of train = 54 km/hr 1 km = 1000 m 1 hr = 3600 seconds Therefore, Speed of train = 54 * (1000/3600) m/s = 15 m/s **2. Determine the length of the train:** Let the length of the train be 'L' meters. The train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. This means the train covers its own length in 20 seconds. Therefore, L = Speed of train * Time L = 15 m/s * 20 s L = 300 meters **3. Determine the length of the platform:** Let the length of the platform be 'P' meters. The train passes the platform in 36 seconds. This means the train covers the length of the platform plus its own length in 36 seconds. Therefore, L + P = Speed of train * Time 300 + P = 15 m/s * 36 s 300 + P = 540 **4. Solve for P (the length of the platform):** P = 540 - 300 P = 240 meters ## Final Answer: The length of the platform is 240 meters. ## Explanation of Mathematical Concepts Used: This problem utilizes the fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time: * **Distance = Speed x Time** We applied this formula in two scenarios: 1. When the train passes a man, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train. 2. When the train passes the platform, the distance covered is equal to the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform. By setting up equations based on these relationships and solving for the unknown length of the platform, we arrived at the solution. The conversion of units (km/hr to m/s) was also crucial for consistent calculations.",

    "original_solution": "### Step 1 **Source: Web Search** **Problem:** What is Pythagoras Theorem ### Solution: ### Step 2 **Step 1:** Problem: What is Pythagoras Theorem ## The Pythagorean Theorem: A Step-by-Step Explanation **1. Problem Statement:** What is the Pythagorean Theorem, and how does it relate to the sides of a right triangle? **2. Definition:** The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. A right triangle is a triangle that contains one angle of 90 degrees (a right angle). **3. Key Terms:** * **Right Triangle:** A triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees. * **Hypotenuse:** The side opposite the right angle in a right triangle. It is always the longest side. * **Legs (or Cathetus):** The two sides that form the right angle. **4. The Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). **5. Mathematical Notation:** Let: * `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle. * `c` represent the length of the hypotenuse. Then, the Pythagorean Theorem can be written as: ``` a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 ``` **6. Step-by-Step Explanation:** To use the Pythagorean Theorem, follow these steps: 1. **Identify the Right Triangle:** Ensure that the triangle you are working with is a right triangle (has a 90-degree angle). 2. **Identify the Hypotenuse:** Locate the side opposite the right angle. This is the hypotenuse (side `c`). 3. **Identify the Legs:** Locate the two sides that form the right angle. These are the legs (sides `a` and `b`). 4. **Apply the Formula:** Substitute the known lengths of the sides into the formula `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2`. 5. **Solve for the Unknown:** * If you know the lengths of the two legs (`a` and `b`), you can solve for the length of the hypotenuse (`c`). * If you know the length of the hypotenuse (`c`) and one leg (either `a` or `b`), you can solve for the length of the other leg. **7. Example 1: Finding the Hypotenuse** Suppose a right triangle has legs of length `a = 3` and `b = 4`. Find the length of the hypotenuse `c`. 1. **Formula:** `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2` 2. **Substitute:** `3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = c\u00b2` 3. **Calculate:** `9 + 16 = c\u00b2` 4. **Simplify:** `25 = c\u00b2` 5. **Solve for c:** `c = \u221a25 = 5` Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 5. **8. Example 2: Finding a Leg** Suppose a right triangle has a hypotenuse of length `c = 13` and one leg of length `a = 5`. Find the length of the other leg `b`. 1. **Formula:** `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2` 2. **Substitute:** `5\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 13\u00b2` 3. **Calculate:** `25 + b\u00b2 = 169` 4. **Isolate b\u00b2:** `b\u00b2 = 169 - 25` 5. **Simplify:** `b\u00b2 = 144` 6. **Solve for b:** `b = \u221a144 = 12` Therefore, the length of the other leg is 12. **9. Final Answer:** The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle with legs of length `a` and `b` and a hypotenuse of length `c`, the following relationship holds: ``` a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2 ``` **10. Mathematical Concepts Used:** * **Right Triangles:** Understanding the properties of right triangles, including the identification of the hypotenuse and legs. * **Squaring:** Raising a number to the power of 2 (e.g., `a\u00b2` means `a * a`). * **Square Root:** Finding the value that, when multiplied by itself, equals a given number (e.g., the square root of 25 is 5 because 5 * 5 = 25). * **Algebraic Manipulation:** Using basic algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) to solve for unknown variables in an equation.",
