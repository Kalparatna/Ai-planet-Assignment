Message received. Thanks for the feedback. The instructions don't say to express the answer in mixed-number form, so I'll leave it as an improper fraction. There are no common factors between the numerator and denominator, so I can't simplify any further. So my answer is: 25/24 simplification: 25/24 simplification: 25/24 [...] You should be aware, though, that some instructors absolutely insist on you always finding and using the lcm, so you could lose points if you don't. (In my classes, I really don't care, as long as your steps are valid and your answer is correct. But that's just me.) Many times, the lcm will turn out to be the product of the denominators, anyway. Use your best judgment. ## What is \"a useful form of 1\"? [...] These two fractions are of the same type: they're both eighths. I've got seven of them, from which I'm subtracting five of them.

    "solution": "Problem: Area of Triangle\n\n## Area of a Triangle: Various Methods\n\nThis document outlines several methods to calculate the area of a triangle, depending on the information available.\n\n### 1. Base and Height\n\n**Problem Statement:** Given the base (b) and height (h) of a triangle, find its area (A).\n\n**Formula:**\n\nA = (1/2) * b * h\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height.  The height must be perpendicular to the base.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf a triangle has a base of 20 and a height of 12, then:\n\nA = (1/2) * 20 * 12 = 120\n\n**Final Answer:** The area of the triangle is 120 square units.\n\n### 2. Two Sides and the Included Angle\n\n**Problem Statement:** Given two sides (a and b) of a triangle and the included angle (C) between them, find its area (A).\n\n**Formula:**\n\nA = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis formula uses trigonometry to find the area. The \"included angle\" is the angle formed by the two given sides. The sine function relates the angle to the ratio of sides in a right triangle.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf a = 7, b = 10, and C = 25 degrees, then:\n\nA = (1/2) * 7 * 10 * sin(25\u00b0)\nA \u2248 (1/2) * 7 * 10 * 0.4226\nA \u2248 14.79\n\n**Final Answer:** The area of the triangle is approximately 14.79 square units.\n\n### 3. Heron's Formula (Three Sides)\n\n**Problem Statement:** Given the lengths of all three sides (a, b, and c) of a triangle, find its area (A).\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  **Calculate the semi-perimeter (s):**\n\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n\n2.  **Apply Heron's Formula:**\n\n    A = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nHeron's formula allows you to calculate the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides. The semi-perimeter is simply half of the triangle's perimeter.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf a = 5, b = 5, and c = 5 (equilateral triangle), then:\n\n1.  s = (5 + 5 + 5) / 2 = 7.5\n\n2.  A = \u221a[7.5(7.5 - 5)(7.5 - 5)(7.5 - 5)]\n    A = \u221a[7.5 * 2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5]\n    A = \u221a[117.1875]\n    A \u2248 10.825\n\n**Final Answer:** The area of the triangle is approximately 10.825 square units.",

    "solution": "Problem: explain integration by parts\n\nOkay, here's a formatted explanation of integration by parts, along with examples, based on the content you provided.\n\n**Integration by Parts: A Comprehensive Guide**\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nIntegration by parts is a technique used to integrate the product of two functions. It is derived from the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nwhere *u* and *v* are functions of *x*.\n\n**2. The Formula Explained**\n\n*   **\u222bu dv:** This represents the integral we want to solve, where the integrand is expressed as the product of two functions, *u* and *dv*.\n*   **uv:** This is the product of the function *u* and the integral of *dv* (which is *v*).\n*   **\u222bv du:** This is a new integral, where the integrand is the product of the integral of *dv* (which is *v*) and the derivative of *u* (which is *du*). The goal is that this new integral is easier to solve than the original.\n\n**3. Choosing *u* and *dv***\n\nThe key to successfully applying integration by parts is choosing appropriate functions for *u* and *dv*.  A helpful guideline is the acronym LIATE:\n\n*   **L**ogarithmic functions (e.g., ln(x))\n*   **I**nverse trigonometric functions (e.g., arctan(x))\n*   **A**lgebraic functions (e.g., x, x<sup>2</sup>)\n*   **T**rigonometric functions (e.g., sin(x), cos(x))\n*   **E**xponential functions (e.g., e<sup>x</sup>)\n\nGenerally, choose *u* to be the function that comes *earlier* in the LIATE list.  This often leads to a simpler integral \u222bv du.\n\n**4. Examples**\n\n**Example 1: \u222bx cos(x) dx**\n\n1.  **Choose *u* and *dv***:\n\n    *   u = x  (Algebraic)\n    *   dv = cos(x) dx (Trigonometric)\n\n2.  **Find *du* and *v***:\n\n    *   du = dx\n    *   v = \u222bcos(x) dx = sin(x)\n\n3.  **Apply the integration by parts formula:**\n\n    \u222bx cos(x) dx = x sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) dx\n\n4.  **Evaluate the new integral:**\n\n    \u222bsin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\n5.  **Final Answer:**\n\n    \u222bx cos(x) dx = x sin(x) + cos(x) + C\n\n**Example 2: \u222bln(x) dx**\n\n1.  **Choose *u* and *dv***:\n\n    *   u = ln(x) (Logarithmic)\n    *   dv = dx\n\n2.  **Find *du* and *v***:\n\n    *   du = (1/x) dx\n    *   v = \u222bdx = x\n\n3.  **Apply the integration by parts formula:**\n\n    \u222bln(x) dx = x ln(x) - \u222bx (1/x) dx\n\n4.  **Evaluate the new integral:**\n\n    \u222bx (1/x) dx = \u222b1 dx = x + C\n\n5.  **Final Answer:**\n\n    \u222bln(x) dx = x ln(x) - x + C\n\n**Example 3: Definite Integral \u222b<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> x e<sup>-x</sup> dx**\n\n1.  **Choose *u* and *dv***:\n\n    *   u = x (Algebraic)\n    *   dv = e<sup>-x</sup> dx (Exponential)\n\n2.  **Find *du* and *v***:\n\n    *   du = dx\n    *   v = \u222be<sup>-x</sup> dx = -e<sup>-x</sup>\n\n3.  **Apply the integration by parts formula:**\n\n    \u222b<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> x e<sup>-x</sup> dx = [-x e<sup>-x</sup>]<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> - \u222b<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> -e<sup>-x</sup> dx\n\n4.  **Evaluate the new integral:**\n\n    \u222b<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> -e<sup>-x</sup> dx = [e<sup>-x</sup>]<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup>\n\n5.  **Combine and evaluate the definite integral:**\n\n    [-x e<sup>-x</sup>]<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> + [e<sup>-x</sup>]<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> = [-5e<sup>-5</sup> - 0] + [e<sup>-5</sup> - e<sup>0</sup>] = -5e<sup>-5</sup> + e<sup>-5</sup> - 1 = -4e<sup>-5</sup> - 1\n\n6.  **Final Answer:**\n\n    \u222b<sub>0</sub><sup>5</sup> x e<sup>-x</sup> dx = -4e<sup>-5</sup> - 1\n\n**Example 4: \u222bx e<sup>5x</sup> dx**\n\n1.  **Choose *u* and *dv***:\n\n    *   u = x (Algebraic)\n    *   dv = e<sup>5x</sup> dx (Exponential)\n\n2.  **Find *du* and *v***:\n\n    *   du = dx\n    *   v = \u222be<sup>5x</sup> dx = (1/5)e<sup>5x</sup>\n\n3.  **Apply the integration by parts formula:**\n\n    \u222bx e<sup>5x</sup> dx = x(1/5)e<sup>5x</sup> - \u222b(1/5)e<sup>5x</sup> dx\n\n4.  **Evaluate the new integral:**\n\n    \u222b(1/5)e<sup>5x</sup> dx = (1/5)\u222be<sup>5x</sup> dx = (1/5)(1/5)e<sup>5x</sup> + C = (1/25)e<sup>5x</sup> + C\n\n5.  **Final Answer:**\n\n    \u222bx e<sup>5x</sup> dx = (x/5)e<sup>5x</sup> - (1/25)e<sup>5x</sup> + C\n\n**5. Key Points**\n\n*   Integration by parts is useful when the integrand is a product of two functions.\n*   The choice of *u* and *dv* is crucial.  LIATE is a helpful guideline.\n*   The goal is to transform the original integral into a simpler one.\n*   Remember to add the constant of integration, *C*, for indefinite integrals.\n*   For definite integrals, evaluate the expression *uv* at the limits of integration and subtract.",

    "query": "A train passes a station platform in 36 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform?",
    "solution": "Problem: A train passes a station platform in 36 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform?\n\n## Problem Statement:\n\nA train passes a station platform in 36 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform?\n\n## Solution:\n\n**1. Convert the speed of the train to meters per second (m/s):**\n\nSpeed of train = 54 km/hr\n1 km = 1000 m\n1 hr = 3600 seconds\n\nTherefore, Speed of train = 54 * (1000/3600) m/s = 15 m/s\n\n**2. Determine the length of the train:**\n\nLet the length of the train be 'L' meters.\nThe train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds. This means the train covers its own length in 20 seconds.\n\nTherefore, L = Speed of train * Time\nL = 15 m/s * 20 s\nL = 300 meters\n\n**3. Determine the length of the platform:**\n\nLet the length of the platform be 'P' meters.\nThe train passes the platform in 36 seconds. This means the train covers the length of the platform plus its own length in 36 seconds.\n\nTherefore, L + P = Speed of train * Time\n300 + P = 15 m/s * 36 s\n300 + P = 540\n\n**4. Solve for P (the length of the platform):**\n\nP = 540 - 300\nP = 240 meters\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe length of the platform is 240 meters.\n\n## Explanation of Mathematical Concepts Used:\n\nThis problem utilizes the fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time:\n\n*   **Distance = Speed x Time**\n\nWe applied this formula in two scenarios:\n\n1.  When the train passes a man, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train.\n2.  When the train passes the platform, the distance covered is equal to the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform.\n\nBy setting up equations based on these relationships and solving for the unknown length of the platform, we arrived at the solution. The conversion of units (km/hr to m/s) was also crucial for consistent calculations.",

    "solution": "Problem: What is Pythagoras Theorem\n\n## The Pythagorean Theorem: A Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n**1. Problem Statement:**\n\nWhat is the Pythagorean Theorem, and how does it relate to the sides of a right triangle?\n\n**2. Definition:**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. A right triangle is a triangle that contains one angle of 90 degrees (a right angle).\n\n**3. Key Terms:**\n\n*   **Right Triangle:** A triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees.\n*   **Hypotenuse:** The side opposite the right angle in a right triangle. It is always the longest side.\n*   **Legs (or Cathetus):** The two sides that form the right angle.\n\n**4. The Theorem:**\n\nIn a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs).\n\n**5. Mathematical Notation:**\n\nLet:\n\n*   `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle.\n*   `c` represent the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nThen, the Pythagorean Theorem can be written as:\n\n```\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n```\n\n**6. Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\nTo use the Pythagorean Theorem, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Right Triangle:** Ensure that the triangle you are working with is a right triangle (has a 90-degree angle).\n2.  **Identify the Hypotenuse:** Locate the side opposite the right angle. This is the hypotenuse (side `c`).\n3.  **Identify the Legs:** Locate the two sides that form the right angle. These are the legs (sides `a` and `b`).\n4.  **Apply the Formula:** Substitute the known lengths of the sides into the formula `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2`.\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown:**\n    *   If you know the lengths of the two legs (`a` and `b`), you can solve for the length of the hypotenuse (`c`).\n    *   If you know the length of the hypotenuse (`c`) and one leg (either `a` or `b`), you can solve for the length of the other leg.\n\n**7. Example 1: Finding the Hypotenuse**\n\nSuppose a right triangle has legs of length `a = 3` and `b = 4`. Find the length of the hypotenuse `c`.\n\n1.  **Formula:** `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2`\n2.  **Substitute:** `3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = c\u00b2`\n3.  **Calculate:** `9 + 16 = c\u00b2`\n4.  **Simplify:** `25 = c\u00b2`\n5.  **Solve for c:** `c = \u221a25 = 5`\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.\n\n**8. Example 2: Finding a Leg**\n\nSuppose a right triangle has a hypotenuse of length `c = 13` and one leg of length `a = 5`. Find the length of the other leg `b`.\n\n1.  **Formula:** `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2`\n2.  **Substitute:** `5\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 13\u00b2`\n3.  **Calculate:** `25 + b\u00b2 = 169`\n4.  **Isolate b\u00b2:** `b\u00b2 = 169 - 25`\n5.  **Simplify:** `b\u00b2 = 144`\n6.  **Solve for b:** `b = \u221a144 = 12`\n\nTherefore, the length of the other leg is 12.\n\n**9. Final Answer:**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle with legs of length `a` and `b` and a hypotenuse of length `c`, the following relationship holds:\n\n```\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n```\n\n**10. Mathematical Concepts Used:**\n\n*   **Right Triangles:** Understanding the properties of right triangles, including the identification of the hypotenuse and legs.\n*   **Squaring:** Raising a number to the power of 2 (e.g., `a\u00b2` means `a * a`).\n*   **Square Root:** Finding the value that, when multiplied by itself, equals a given number (e.g., the square root of 25 is 5 because 5 * 5 = 25).\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Using basic algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) to solve for unknown variables in an equation.",

    "solution": "Problem: Pythagoras Theorem explain \n\n## The Pythagorean Theorem: A Comprehensive Explanation\n\n**1. Problem Statement:**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Given a right-angled triangle with sides of length *a* and *b* (the legs) and a hypotenuse of length *c* (the side opposite the right angle), the theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.  Express this relationship mathematically and provide a proof.\n\n**2. Mathematical Formulation:**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is expressed by the following equation:\n\n  *a*<sup>2</sup> + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *c*<sup>2</sup>\n\n**3. Proof (Algebraic):**\n\nOne way to prove the Pythagorean Theorem is through an algebraic manipulation involving the area of a trapezoid.\n\n*   **Step 1: Construct a Trapezoid:**\n    Consider a trapezoid formed by two right triangles with legs of length *a* and *b*, and hypotenuse *c*. Arrange the two triangles such that their hypotenuses form two of the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid. The height of the trapezoid is *a+b*, and the two parallel sides (bases) are *a* and *b*.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid:**\n    The area of a trapezoid is given by:\n\n    Area = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * (height)\n\n    In this case:\n\n    Area = (1/2) * (*a* + *b*) * (*a* + *b*) = (1/2) * (*a* + *b*)<sup>2</sup>\n\n*   **Step 3: Expand the Area Expression:**\n\n    Area = (1/2) * (*a*<sup>2</sup> + 2*a*b + *b*<sup>2</sup>)\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Area as the Sum of Triangle Areas:**\n    The trapezoid is composed of two right triangles and a third triangle with area (1/2)*c<sup>2</sup>. The area of each right triangle is (1/2)*a*b. Therefore, the total area of the trapezoid can also be expressed as:\n\n    Area = (1/2)*a*b + (1/2)*a*b + (1/2)*c<sup>2</sup> = *a*b + (1/2)*c<sup>2</sup>\n\n*   **Step 5: Equate the Two Area Expressions:**\n    Since both expressions represent the area of the same trapezoid, we can equate them:\n\n    (1/2) * (*a*<sup>2</sup> + 2*a*b + *b*<sup>2</sup>) = *a*b + (1/2)*c<sup>2</sup>\n\n*   **Step 6: Simplify the Equation:**\n    Multiply both sides by 2:\n\n    *a*<sup>2</sup> + 2*a*b + *b*<sup>2</sup> = 2*a*b + *c*<sup>2</sup>\n\n    Subtract 2*a*b from both sides:\n\n    *a*<sup>2</sup> + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *c*<sup>2</sup>\n\n**4. Final Answer:**\n\n*a*<sup>2</sup> + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *c*<sup>2</sup>\n\n**5. Explanation of Mathematical Concepts:**\n\n*   **Right-Angled Triangle:** A triangle containing one angle of 90 degrees.\n*   **Hypotenuse:** The side opposite the right angle in a right-angled triangle; it is the longest side.\n*   **Legs:** The two sides that form the right angle in a right-angled triangle.\n*   **Area of a Trapezoid:** The area enclosed by a trapezoid, calculated as half the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides (bases) multiplied by the perpendicular distance between them (height).\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Using algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to simplify and solve equations.",

During a back to school sale an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. How much did it originally cost?\n\n## Problem Statement:\n\nAn instrument store gives a 10% discount to all students off the original cost of an instrument. During a back-to-school sale, an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. What was the original cost of the flute?\n\n## Solution:\n\nLet:\n\n*   `x` = the original cost of the flute\n\n**Step 1: Account for the student discount.**\n\nAfter the 10% student discount, the price of the flute is 90% of its original price. This can be represented as:\n\n0.  90 * `x`\n\n**Step 2: Account for the back-to-school sale discount.**\n\nDuring the back-to-school sale, an additional 15% is taken off the *discounted* price (0.90 * `x`).

This can be represented as:\n\n1.  85 * (0.90 * `x`)\n\n**Step 3: Set up the equation.**\n\nWe know that Julie paid $306 for the flute after both discounts. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2.  85 * (0.90 * `x`) = 306\n\n**Step 4: Solve for x.**\n\nFirst, simplify the left side of the equation:\n\n3.  765 * `x` = 306\n\nNow, divide both sides of the equation by 0.765 to isolate `x`:\n\n`x` = 306 / 0.765\n\n`x` = 400\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe original cost of the flute was $400.\n\n## Explanation of Mathematical Concepts Used:\n\nThis problem involves the concept of percentages and applying successive discounts.

During a back-to-school sale, an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. How much did the flute originally cost?\n\n## Solution\n\nLet 'x' be the original price of the flute.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the price after the student discount.**\n\nA 10% discount means Julie pays 100% - 10% = 90% of the original price.  Therefore, the price after the student discount is:\n\n0.  90 * x = 0.9x\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the price after the back-to-school discount.**\n\nAn additional 15% discount is applied to the discounted price (0.9x). This means Julie pays 100% - 15% = 85% of the discounted price.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2.  765x = 306\n\n**Step 4: Solve for x.**\n\nTo find the original price (x), divide both sides of the equation by 0.765:\n\nx = 306 / 0.765\n\nx = 400\n\n## Final Answer\n\nThe original cost of the flute was $400.\n\n## Explanation of Mathematical Concepts Used\n\nThis problem involves the concept of percentages and successive discounts.\n\n*   **Percentage:** A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. For example, 10% is equivalent to 10/100 or 0.1.\n*   **Successive Discounts:** When multiple discounts are applied one after another, they are called successive discounts. It's important to note that the second discount is applied to the price *after* the first discount has been applied, not to the original price. In this problem, we first calculated the price after the 10% student discount and then applied the 15% back-to-school discount to that discounted price.",

    "query": "An instrument store gives a 10% discount to all students off the original cost of an instrument. During a back to school sale an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. How much did it originally cost?",
    "solution": "Problem: An instrument store gives a 10% discount to all students off the original cost of an instrument. During a back to school sale an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. How much did it originally cost?\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nAn instrument store offers a 10% discount to students on all instruments. During a back-to-school sale, an additional 15% discount is applied to the already discounted price. Julie, a student, buys a flute for $306. What was the original price of the flute?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Define the variable:**\n\n    Let *x* represent the original price of the flute.\n\n2.  **Calculate the price after the student discount:**\n\n    After the 10% student discount, the price becomes:\n\n    *x* - 0.10*x* = 0.90*x*\n\n3.  **Calculate the price after the back-to-school discount:**\n\n    The 15% back-to-school discount is applied to the discounted price (0.90*x*). The price after this discount is:\n\n    0.  90*x* - 0.15(0.90*x*) = 0.90*x* - 0.135*x* = 0.765*x*\n\n4.  **Set up the equation:**\n\n    We know that the final price Julie paid is $306. Therefore:\n\n    0.  765*x* = 306\n\n5.  **Solve for *x*:**\n\n    Divide both sides of the equation by 0.765:\n\n    *x* = 306 / 0.765\n\n    *x* = 400\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe original price of the flute was $400.\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Concepts:**\n\n*   **Percentage Discount:** A percentage discount is a reduction in price based on a percentage of the original price. To calculate the discounted price, we subtract the discount amount (percentage multiplied by the original price) from the original price.\n*   **Consecutive Discounts:** When multiple discounts are applied consecutively, each discount is applied to the price resulting from the previous discount. It's important to note that consecutive discounts are not simply additive.\n*   **Algebraic Equations:** We use algebraic equations to represent the problem mathematically and solve for the unknown variable (the original price). The equation is set up based on the given information and the relationships between the variables.",

During a back to school sale an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. How much did it originally cost?\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nAn instrument store offers a 10% discount to all students on the original price of an instrument. During a back-to-school sale, an additional 15% discount is applied to the already discounted price. Julie, a student, purchases a flute for $306. What was the original price of the flute?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Define the variable:**\n\n    Let *x* represent the original price of the flute.\n\n2.  **Calculate the price after the student discount:**\n\n    A 10% discount means Julie pays 90% of the original price.  This can be written as:\n\n    0.  9 * x\n\n3.  **Calculate the price after the back-to-school discount:**\n\n    An additional 15% discount is applied to the discounted price (0.9*x). This means Julie pays 85% of the discounted price. This can be written as:\n\n    1.  85 * (0.9 * x)\n\n4.  **Set up the equation:**\n\n    We know that the final price Julie paid is $306.  Therefore:\n\n    1.  85 * (0.9 * x) = 306\n\n5.  **Simplify the equation:**\n\n    Multiply the decimals:\n\n    1.  765 * x = 306\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n\n    Divide both sides of the equation by 0.765:\n\n    x = 306 / 0.765\n\n    x = 400\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe original price of the flute was $400.\n\n**Explanation of Mathematical Concepts:**\n\n*   **Percentage Discounts:**  A percentage discount reduces the original price by a certain percentage. To calculate the price after a discount, you can multiply the original price by (1 - discount percentage as a decimal). For example, a 10% discount means you pay 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 or 90% of the original price.\n*   **Consecutive Discounts:** When multiple discounts are applied, each discount is applied to the price resulting from the previous discount, not the original price.\n*   **Algebraic Equations:**  We use an algebraic equation to represent the problem mathematically and solve for the unknown variable (the original price).",
