The bottom numbers (the denominators) are already the same. Go straight to\n\nstep 2.\n\nStep 2. Add the top numbers and put the answer over the same denominator: 1 4 + 1 4 = 1 + 1 4 = 2 4\n\nStep 3.

Message received. Thanks for the feedback. The instructions don't say to express the answer in mixed-number form, so I'll leave it as an improper fraction. There are no common factors between the numerator and denominator, so I can't simplify any further. So my answer is: 25/24 simplification: 25/24 simplification: 25/24 [...] You should be aware, though, that some instructors absolutely insist on you always finding and using the lcm, so you could lose points if you don't. (In my classes, I really don't care, as long as your steps are valid and your answer is correct. But that's just me.) Many times, the lcm will turn out to be the product of the denominators, anyway. Use your best judgment. ## What is \"a useful form of 1\"? [...] These two fractions are of the same type: they're both eighths. I've got seven of them, from which I'm subtracting five of them. This should leave me with two of them. Of course, each one-eighth is half of a one-fourth, so two of the eighths would be a single fourth. 7/8 \u2212 5/8 = (7 \u2212 5)/8 = 2/8 = 1/4\n\n\nConclusion: This solution addresses the mathematical problem by breaking it down into manageable steps and applying the appropriate mathematical principles.",
