    "solution": "Problem: Find the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 7 using the power rule.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to provide a detailed, step-by-step solution to the given problem.\n\n**1. Problem Identification and Concepts Involved**\n\nThis problem asks us to find the derivative of a polynomial function, f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 7.  The primary concept involved is the *power rule* of differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x<sup>n</sup>, then f'(x) = nx<sup>n-1</sup>.  We will also use the constant multiple rule, which states that if f(x) = c*g(x), where c is a constant, then f'(x) = c*g'(x). Finally, we'll use the sum/difference rule, which states that the derivative of a sum or difference of terms is the sum or difference of the derivatives of those terms.  The derivative of a constant is zero.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nHere's how we'll find the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 7:\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Sum/Difference Rule**\n\nThe derivative of a sum (or difference) is the sum (or difference) of the derivatives.  Therefore, we can differentiate each term separately:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x\u00b3) + d/dx (2x\u00b2) - d/dx (4x) + d/dx (7)\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Power Rule and Constant Multiple Rule to the first term (x\u00b3)**\n\n*   We have d/dx (x\u00b3).\n*   Using the power rule, where n = 3, we get 3x<sup>3-1</sup> = 3x\u00b2.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Power Rule and Constant Multiple Rule to the second term (2x\u00b2)**\n\n*   We have d/dx (2x\u00b2).\n*   Using the constant multiple rule, we can write this as 2 * d/dx (x\u00b2).\n*   Using the power rule, where n = 2, we get 2 * (2x<sup>2-1</sup>) = 2 * (2x) = 4x.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Power Rule and Constant Multiple Rule to the third term (-4x)**\n\n*   We have d/dx (-4x).\n*   Using the constant multiple rule, we can write this as -4 * d/dx (x).\n*   Since x = x<sup>1</sup>, using the power rule, where n = 1, we get -4 * (1x<sup>1-1</sup>) = -4 * (1x<sup>0</sup>) = -4 * (1) = -4.\n\n**Step 5: Find the derivative of the constant term (7)**\n\n*   We have d/dx (7).\n*   The derivative of a constant is always zero. Therefore, d/dx (7) = 0.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results**\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 4 + 0\n\n**Step 7: Simplify**\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 4\n\n**3. Final Answer**\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 7 is:\n\n**f'(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 4**\n\n**4. Verification (Optional, but Recommended)**\n\nWhile there isn't a simple numerical check for derivatives in general, we can consider the behavior of the original function and its derivative.\n\n*   The original function f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 7 is a cubic polynomial.\n*   Its derivative, f'(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 4, is a quadratic polynomial. This is expected, as the derivative reduces the degree of the polynomial by one.\n*   We can also analyze the critical points. The critical points of f(x) occur where f'(x) = 0. Solving 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 4 = 0, we get (3x - 2)(x + 2) = 0, so x = 2/3 and x = -2. These are the x-values where the original function has a local maximum or minimum.  This is consistent with the relationship between a function and its derivative.\n\nTherefore, based on the application of the power rule and the expected behavior of the derivative, we can be confident in our solution.\n",

    "solution": "Problem: An instrument store gives a 10% discount to all students off the original cost of an instrument. During a back to school sale an additional 15% is taken off the discounted price. Julie, a student at the local high school, purchases a flute for $306. How much did it originally cost?\n\nOkay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Problem Identification and Concepts**\n\nThis is a percentage problem involving successive discounts. The key concept here is that each discount is applied to the *new* price after the previous discount has been taken. We need to work backward to find the original price. We will be using the concept of reverse percentages.\n\n**2. Solution Steps**\n\n1.  **Define the Variable:** Let 'x' be the original cost of the flute.\n\n2.  **Account for the Student Discount:** After the 10% student discount, the price becomes x - 0.10x = 0.90x. This means Julie pays 90% of the original price after the student discount.\n\n3.  **Account for the Back-to-School Discount:** The 15% back-to-school discount is applied to the discounted price (0.90x). So, the price after the back-to-school discount is 0.90x - 0.15(0.90x) = 0.90x(1 - 0.15) = 0.90x(0.85). This means Julie pays 85% of the already discounted price.\n\n4.  **Set up the Equation:** We know that the final price Julie paid is $306. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n    0.  90x * 0.85 = 306\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Now, we need to solve for x to find the original cost.\n\n**3. Detailed Explanation and Calculations**\n\n*   **Step 1: Define the Variable**\n    *   We let 'x' represent the unknown original price. This is a standard practice in algebra to represent the quantity we want to find.\n\n*   **Step 2: Account for the Student Discount**\n    *   A 10% discount means the price is reduced by 10% of its original value.\n    *   Mathematically, this is represented as: Original Price - (10% of Original Price)\n    *   Which translates to: x - 0.10x\n    *   Factoring out x, we get: x(1 - 0.10) = 0.90x\n    *   This means the price after the student discount is 90% of the original price.\n\n*   **Step 3: Account for the Back-to-School Discount**\n    *   The 15% discount is applied to the *already discounted* price (0.90x).\n    *   So, the discount amount is 15% of 0.90x, which is 0.15 * (0.90x).\n    *   The new price is the discounted price minus the discount amount: 0.90x - 0.15(0.90x)\n    *   Factoring out 0.90x, we get: 0.90x(1 - 0.15) = 0.90x(0.85)\n    *   This means the price after the back-to-school discount is 85% of the price after the student discount.\n\n*   **Step 4: Set up the Equation**\n    *   We know the final price is $306. This final price is the result of applying both discounts.\n    *   Therefore, 0.90x * 0.85 = 306\n\n*   **Step 5: Solve for x**\n    *   0.  90x * 0.85 = 306\n    *   0.  765x = 306\n    *   x = 306 / 0.765\n    *   x = 400\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe original cost of the flute was $\\boxed{$400}$.\n\n**5. Verification**\n\nLet's check our answer:\n\n*   Original price: $400\n*   Student discount (10%): $400 * 0.10 = $40\n*   Price after student discount: $400 - $40 = $360\n*   Back-to-school discount (15%): $360 * 0.15 = $54\n*   Final price: $360 - $54 = $306\n\nThe final price matches the given information, so our answer is correct.\n",

The key concepts involved are:\\n\\n*   **Percentage:** A way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100.\\n*   **Discount:** A reduction in the original price of an item.\\n*   **Successive Discounts:** Applying multiple discounts one after the other, where each discount is calculated on the price remaining after the previous discount.\\n*   **Working Backwards:** Since we know the final price and the discounts, we need to work backwards to find the original price.\\n\\n**2. Solution Steps**\\n\\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** Julie bought a flute for $306 after two discounts: a 10% student discount and a 15% back-to-school sale discount. We need to find the original price of the flute before any discounts.\\n\\n2.  **Represent the Original Price:** Let 'x' be the original price of the flute.\\n\\n3.  **Calculate the Price After the Student Discount:** A 10% discount means Julie paid 90% of the original price. So, the price after the student discount is 0.90x.\\n\\n4.  **Calculate the Price After the Back-to-School Discount:** A 15% discount on the discounted price (0.90x) means Julie paid 85% of 0.90x. So, the final price is 0.85 * (0.90x).\\n\\n5.  **Set Up the Equation:** We know the final price is $306. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\\n\\n    0.  85 * (0.90x) = 306\\n\\n6.  **Solve for x:** Now, we solve for x to find the original price.\\n\\n**3. Detailed Explanation and Calculations**\\n\\n*   **Step 1 & 2:** As explained above, we define 'x' as the original price.\\n\\n*   **Step 3:**  A 10% discount means the price is reduced by 10% of the original price.  This is equivalent to paying 100% - 10% = 90% of the original price.  Mathematically, this is represented as 0.90 * x.\\n\\n*   **Step 4:** The 15% back-to-school discount is applied *after* the student discount.  This means the 15% is taken off the price *after* the student discount (0.90x).  So, we are paying 100% - 15% = 85% of the discounted price. This is represented as 0.85 * (0.90x).\\n\\n*   **Step 5:** We know the final price after both discounts is $306.  So, we set up the equation: 0.85 * (0.90x) = 306\\n\\n*   **Step 6:** Solving for x:\\n\\n    1.  Simplify the left side of the equation:\\n        0.  85 * 0.90x = 0.765x\\n\\n    2.  Now the equation is:\\n        0.  765x = 306\\n\\n    3.  Divide both sides by 0.765 to isolate x:\\n        x = 306 / 0.765\\n\\n    4.  Calculate the value of x:\\n        x = 400\\n\\n**4. Final Answer**\\n\\nThe original cost of the flute was $\\\\boxed{$400}$.\\n\\n**5. Verification**\\n\\nLet's verify our answer by applying the discounts to the original price we found:\\n\\n1.  **Student Discount:** 10% of $400 is $40.  So, the price after the student discount is $400 - $40 = $360.\\n\\n2.  **Back-to-School Discount:** 15% of $360 is $54.  So, the price after the back-to-school discount is $360 - $54 = $306.\\n\\nSince the final price after both discounts is $306, which matches the given information, our answer is correct.\\n\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run--f648ff16-e3ef-4316-aa33-419199e097ff-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 244, 'output_tokens': 958, 'total_tokens': 1202}",

    "problem": "Find the derivative of x^3 + 2x^2",
    "solution": "Problem: Find the derivative of x^3 + 2x^2\n\ncontent=\"Okay, let's tackle this problem step-by-step.\\n\\n**1. Problem Identification and Concepts**\\n\\nThis problem involves finding the derivative of a polynomial function.  The core concept we'll use is the *power rule* of differentiation. The power rule states that if we have a term of the form *ax<sup>n</sup>*, where *a* is a constant and *n* is a real number, then its derivative with respect to *x* is *nax<sup>n-1</sup>*.  We will also use the *sum rule*, which states that the derivative of a sum of terms is the sum of the derivatives of each term.\\n\\n**2. Solution Steps**\\n\\n1.  **Identify the terms:** The function we want to differentiate is *f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup>*.  It consists of two terms: *x<sup>3</sup>* and *2x<sup>2</sup>*.\\n\\n2.  **Apply the power rule to the first term:**  Consider the term *x<sup>3</sup>*. Here, *a = 1* and *n = 3*. Applying the power rule, the derivative of *x<sup>3</sup>* with respect to *x* is:\\n    *   3 * 1 * x<sup>3-1</sup> = 3x<sup>2</sup>\\n\\n3.  **Apply the power rule to the second term:** Consider the term *2x<sup>2</sup>*. Here, *a = 2* and *n = 2*. Applying the power rule, the derivative of *2x<sup>2</sup>* with respect to *x* is:\\n    *   2 * 2 * x<sup>2-1</sup> = 4x<sup>1</sup> = 4x\\n\\n4.  **Apply the sum rule:** The derivative of the entire function *f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup>* is the sum of the derivatives of its individual terms. Therefore:\\n    *   *f'(x) = (derivative of x<sup>3</sup>) + (derivative of 2x<sup>2</sup>)*\\n    *   *f'(x) = 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x*\\n\\n**3. Explanation of Steps**\\n\\n*   **Step 1:** We simply identified the individual terms in the polynomial. This is important for applying the sum rule later.\\n*   **Step 2:** We applied the power rule to the first term, *x<sup>3</sup>*.  The exponent (3) became the coefficient, and the exponent was reduced by 1 (3-1 = 2).\\n*   **Step 3:** We applied the power rule to the second term, *2x<sup>2</sup>*.  The exponent (2) was multiplied by the existing coefficient (2), resulting in a new coefficient of 4. The exponent was reduced by 1 (2-1 = 1).\\n*   **Step 4:** We used the sum rule to combine the derivatives of the individual terms, giving us the derivative of the entire function.\\n\\n**4.

Final Answer**\\n\\nThe derivative of *x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup>* is *3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x*.\\n\\n**6. Verification (Optional)**\\n\\nWhile a rigorous proof requires more advanced techniques, we can get a sense of the correctness of our answer by considering the behavior of the original function and its derivative at a few points.\\n\\n*   Let's consider *x = 0*.  *f(0) = 0<sup>3</sup> + 2(0)<sup>2</sup> = 0*.  *f'(0) = 3(0)<sup>2</sup> + 4(0) = 0*.  This makes sense, as the function has a minimum (a flat spot) at *x = 0*.\\n*   Let's consider *x = 1*.  *f(1) = 1<sup>3</sup> + 2(1)<sup>2</sup> = 3*.  *f'(1) = 3(1)<sup>2</sup> + 4(1) = 7*.  This tells us that the function is increasing at *x = 1*.\\n*   Let's consider *x = -1*. *f(-1) = (-1)<sup>3</sup> + 2(-1)<sup>2</sup> = -1 + 2 = 1*. *f'(-1) = 3(-1)<sup>2</sup> + 4(-1) = 3 - 4 = -1*. This tells us that the function is decreasing at *x = -1*.\\n\\nThese observations are consistent with the shape of the original function and its derivative, providing some confidence in our result.
