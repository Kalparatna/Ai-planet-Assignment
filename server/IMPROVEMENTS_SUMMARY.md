# Math Routing Agent - Recent Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the major improvements made to the Math Routing Agent system to enhance search prioritization, source attribution, and content generation capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. PDF-First Search Flow
**Problem**: Previously, the system searched knowledge base first, then PDFs, then web search.
**Solution**: Reorganized search priority to prioritize uploaded PDF documents first.

**New Search Order**:
1. **PDF Documents** (Highest Priority) - User-uploaded content
2. **JEE Bench Dataset** - Comprehensive exam problems from Hugging Face
3. **Local Knowledge Base** - Curated math problems
4. **Web Search** - External sources
5. **AI Generated** - LLM-generated solutions (Fallback)

### 2. Enhanced Source Attribution
**Problem**: Sources were not clearly identified in responses.
**Solution**: Added detailed source attribution with visual indicators.

**Source Indicators**:
- üìÑ PDF Documents with filename and chunk information
- üéØ JEE Bench Dataset with category information
- üìö Knowledge Base entries
- üåê Web search results with URLs
- ü§ñ AI-generated solutions

### 3. JEE Bench Dataset Integration
**Problem**: Limited problem database with only sample data.
**Solution**: Integrated JEE Bench dataset from Hugging Face (`daman1209arora/jeebench`).

**Features**:
- Automatic dataset loading from Hugging Face
- Separate Pinecone index for JEE problems
- Category and topic-based organization
- High-quality exam-level problems

### 4. Requirements and Assignment Generation
**Problem**: No capability to generate educational content.
**Solution**: Added comprehensive content generation features.

**New Endpoints**:
- `/math/generate-assignment` - Creates assignments with problems and rubrics
- `/math/generate-requirements` - Generates project requirements documents
- `/math/jee-bench-status` - Checks JEE Bench dataset status

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Services

#### KnowledgeBaseService
- Added `query_jee_bench()` method for JEE dataset queries
- Added `generate_assignment()` for assignment creation
- Added `generate_requirements_document()` for project requirements
- Added `_initialize_jee_bench()` for dataset loading
- Added `_load_jee_bench_data()` for Hugging Face integration

#### Math Router
- Updated `/solve` endpoint with new search flow
- Added source attribution in responses
- Added new endpoints for content generation
- Enhanced error handling and logging

#### PDF Processor
- Maintained existing functionality
- Enhanced integration with new search flow
- Improved source attribution for PDF results

### Dependencies Added
- `datasets==2.16.1` - For Hugging Face dataset integration

### New Files Created
- `load_jee_bench.py` - Script to manually load JEE Bench data
- `test_new_features.py` - Comprehensive testing script
- `test_search_flow.py` - Search flow demonstration script

## API Changes

### Enhanced Response Format
```json
{
  "solution": "**Source: PDF Document**\n\nStep-by-step solution...",
  "source": "pdf_upload",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "references": ["üìÑ mathematics_textbook.pdf (Chunk 3)"]
}
```

### New Request Models
```python
class AssignmentRequest(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    difficulty: str = "Medium"
    num_problems: int = 5

class RequirementsRequest(BaseModel):
    project_type: str
    subject: str
    complexity: str = "Medium"
```

## Usage Examples

### Generate Assignment
```bash
POST /math/generate-assignment
{
  "topic": "Calculus - Derivatives",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "num_problems": 5
}
```

### Generate Requirements Document
```bash
POST /math/generate-requirements
{
  "project_type": "Scientific Calculator App",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "complexity": "Medium"
}
```

### Check JEE Bench Status
```bash
GET /math/jee-bench-status
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: PDF-first search ensures user-uploaded content takes priority
2. **Better Source Tracking**: Clear attribution shows where solutions come from
3. **Expanded Content**: JEE Bench dataset provides thousands of high-quality problems
4. **Educational Tools**: Assignment and requirements generation for teaching
5. **Scalability**: Modular design allows easy addition of new data sources

## Testing

Run the following scripts to test the new features:

```bash
# Test JEE Bench loading
python load_jee_bench.py

# Test all new features
python test_new_features.py

# Demonstrate search flow
python test_search_flow.py
```

## Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file includes:
```
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=math-routing-agent
PINECONE_EMBEDDING_MODEL=llama-text-embed-v2
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-language Support**: Extend JEE Bench to support multiple languages
2. **Custom Dataset Upload**: Allow users to upload their own problem datasets
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by difficulty, topic, or source type
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track usage patterns and popular topics
5. **Collaborative Features**: Allow users to contribute problems and solutions
